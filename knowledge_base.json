        "yes": "Post-service drift is common. Please verify temperature and pressure corrections. If the trend continues for 3+ days, a baseline recalibration might be needed.",
        "no": "Understood. Please check for environmental changes. Have you verified the temperature and pressure of the chamber water? Significant changes can cause output drift."
